• Supports a strong immune system
• Has a positive effect on skin health
• Improves mood, increases vitality', 'Contrary to popular belief, vitamin D affects not only bone tissue, but also the small intestine, kidneys, other organs and systems. People with low levels of this vitamin get SARS significantly more often than those who are provided with them in sufficient quantities.
The vitamin D content in food is low, therefore, with normal nutrition, there is a deficiency in the body, which dictates the need for its additional intake. It was found that with a daily intake of 1000 IU (25 mcg) of vitamin D, its blood level rises to the lower threshold of normal. In order to ensure the optimal content of vitamin D (50-60 ng / ml), it is recommended to take at least 50-100 mcg per day and regularly monitor the indicator of 25-oxyvitamin D in the blood. This is especially true for people who are at risk and have chronic diseases.
Chronic vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for the development of a number of serious diseases such as cancer, autoimmune, cardiovascular and others. Vitamin D deficiency is a provoking factor of psoriasis and vitiligo, as well as other autoimmune diseases. With a lack of vitamin D, memory impairment, muscle pain, insomnia are noted. Vitamin D deficiency is the main cause of rickets in children.
The lack of this vitamin can occur with its deficiency in nutrition, with its insufficient formation in the skin under the influence of sunlight, with liver and kidney diseases, where the second and third stages of its metabolism take place. Vitamin D deficiency is the main cause of rickets in children. Vitamin D3 NSP is a source of high–quality vitamin D in a convenient dosage.
The monoproduct of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the optimal dosage is 600 IU (15 mcg, 150% of the adequate daily requirement). Convenient use for adults (it is easy to dial the right dosage) and for children (a small absorbable tablet with the taste of peach and tropical fruits). Large packaging. Vitamin D3 is obtained from natural, environmentally friendly raw materials from Australia and New Zealand.', 'Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a fat–soluble vitamin. This vitamin can be formed in human skin under the influence of ultraviolet sunlight. Russia is located in a zone of low insolation and is included in the group of countries at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Another type of this vitamin – D2 enters the human body from plant products and is called ergocalciferol. Vitamin D3 is absorbed by about 50%, while the digestibility of D2 is lower. The biological activity of vitamin D3 is also significantly higher than D2.
It has been established that vitamin D is important for the regulation of immunity. It prevents the development of cardiovascular, autoimmune and oncological diseases. Under the influence of vitamin D, the formation of blood cells occurs, it has an anti-inflammatory effect.', 'Dietary supplement Vitamin D3 NSP is an additional source of vitamin D3.

It has a positive effect on the work of the liver, brain, kidneys and other organs', 'Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone, which means "ubiquitous") is a vitamin—like substance of lipid nature, part of the respiratory chain of mitochondria (energy stations of the cell). The production of 95% of cellular energy depends on the work of coenzyme Q10.
It is formed in all cells of the body, however, with high physical activity, stress, in extreme situations and with various diseases, when a large amount of energy is required, there are not enough coenzyme Q10 own resources. With age, the formation of coenzyme decreases (in 60 years — by 40-60%), which accelerates aging. Taking this substance gives a surge of strength and increases efficiency.
Coenzyme Q10 is an effective antioxidant, able to recover during oxidation and restore the activity of vitamin E.
In organs that consume a large amount of energy, such as the heart, liver, brain, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, the content of coenzyme Q10 is increased. Therefore, its deficiency in these organs can be the cause of serious metabolic problems and diseases.
The optimal dose of coenzyme Q10 is 100 mg. The oil base is extra—virgin olive oil. Does not contain GMOs.', 'More than 60 diseases are associated with a deficiency of coenzyme Q10. It is used for various indications:
Cardiology — ischemic heart disease, cardio-myopathy, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, postinfarction, endothelial dysfunction, chronic heart failure, congenital heart defects, cardiac arrhythmia.
Hypertension — lowers blood pressure.
Atherosclerosis — inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol.
Neurology — chronic fatigue syndrome, neurodegenerative and senile diseases, Parkinson''s disease
Muscle diseases — myopathies, including Duchenne dystrophy.
Coenzyme Q10 is recommended to be taken as an ophthalmoprotector for retinal dystrophy; as a hepatoprotector for toxic and viral hepatitis, liver failure; in nephrology for chronic pyelonephritis and metabolic nephropathy; in dermatology to support health and skin rejuvenation, helps with periodontal disease. It has been established that in oncological diseases, coenzyme Q10 contributes to the inhibition of tumor development and reduces the toxicity of antitumor drugs. Coenzyme Q10 stimulates all parts of the immune system, increases the activity of phagocytosis and increases the biosynthesis of antibodies, reduces blood sugar (up to 30%), slows down aging.

Helps the body maintain vascular health.
Promotes the elimination of toxins from the body.
When used in combination, it enhances the effect of other products.', 'The lymphatic system is the only way to drain toxins from the intercellular fluid, where 83% of them are contained, and plays a key role in cleaning the internal environment of the body from toxic and fat-soluble substances, as well as metabolic products. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a pump and works on the principle of a drainage network, where the fluid moves by gravity and pours into the subclavian vein. The promotion of lymph – the fluid that is formed from the intercellular fluid – is helped by physical activity, and drinking enough water increases the volume and speed of the lymph flow. Stress leads to a violation of the outflow of lymph.
The lymphatic system is closely related to the immune function and includes: lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, spleen, bone marrow. In the process of lymph transport through the lymph nodes, it is cleaned of bacteria, viruses and toxins. When the intercellular fluid is overloaded with toxins, the lymphatic ducts may be blocked by the remnants of drained connective tissue. Therefore, stimulation of lymph flow (lymphatic drainage) is one of the most important conditions for the detoxification process of the body, increasing the effectiveness of the immune system and improving the quality of treatment of a variety of diseases.
Lymphatic Drainage is designed to support the normal drainage of the lymphatic system. The product helps to eliminate lymph stagnation, improves the absorption of nutrients and increases immunity.

Historically, it has been used as an immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of colds, diarrhea, fatigue and anorexia.
The main actions of astragalus:
1. Adaptogenic, anti—inflammatory - increased resistance to infections. Saponins in astragalus have been proven to protect against sepsis by suppressing inflammation. By weakening inflammatory factors, astragalus suppresses tissue damage, such as edema of tissues, including lung.
2. Anti—infective - prevention of viral infections, including colds, respiratory infections and infectious liver diseases (infectious hepatitis).
3. Immunomodulating and supporting the immune system — the activity of the astragalus root in this direction has been proven. In relation to patients with a tumor process, astragalus increases resistance to infections in these patients.
4. Antitumor — used to stimulate apoptosis (natural programmed death of cancer cells). There is a relief of side effects of chemotherapy (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea). At the same time, the maximum effectiveness of astragalus is observed during the first week of treatment.
5. Cardiotonic and vasodilator — improving heart function and reducing the severity of symptoms in heart diseases. Astragalus dilates blood vessels and increases the amount of blood pumped from the heart.
6. Lowering and controlling blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes. The addition of astragalus to the diet helps to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes both after a period without eating (for example, sleep) and after eating with daily use of this product for 4 months.
7. Weight loss due to improved carbohydrate metabolism.
8. Improving kidney function and maintaining their health. Improves the indicators of protein in the urine (proteinuria) — a sign of damage or impaired kidney function. Astragalus provides prevention of infections and risk of inflammation in people with reduced kidney function when taken daily for 3-6 months.
9. Tonic — reduces the manifestations of chronic fatigue syndrome.
10. Anti—allergic - relieves the symptoms of seasonal allergies (sneezing, runny nose).
11. Geroprotective — the ability of astragalus to stop cellular aging and slow down the shortening of telomeres has been proven. Telomeres are "protective caps" on chromosomes that thin with age and are a sign of cellular aging. Dr. Bill Edwards, USA, discovered the enzyme telomerase in germ cells, which restores telomeres to transmit age information to subsequent generations. Astragalus slows down and reverses telomere shortening, as well as restores and improves cellular function.', 'Dietary supplement Astragalus is a source of polyphenolic compounds, contains triterpene saponins.

Restores intestinal microflora.', 'Beneficial microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract (enterococci, E. coli, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli) are involved in digestion and metabolism. Moreover, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli contribute to the formation of the body''s immune defense and stimulate local immunity. In diseases of the digestive system, infectious diseases, and food allergies in children, a violation of the intestinal flora, called dysbiosis, is often noted. Dysbiosis in children is a reaction of intestinal bacteria to the effects of adverse external factors and digestive disorders, as a result of which the balance of normal intestinal microflora changes. Treatment of diseases with antibiotics or sulfonamides, overwork can also disrupt the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. At the same time, the so-called conditionally pathogenic (aerobic) flora begins to multiply intensively. Dysbiosis is often accompanied by: constipation, diarrhea, increased gas formation, bloating, colic. Colonization of the intestine with normal microflora is useful for the elimination of dysbiosis.

Result: clinical manifestations (low bone density, lower back pain, muscle stiffness) decreased more markedly in the main group compared to the control group. Moreover, the result was higher in women than in men (probably due to exposure to Wild Yams). Thus, bone density increased in the main group of women – by 15%, in men – by 6.3%, while in the control group – by only 8% in women and 6.2% in men. The pain syndrome in the main group decreased by 34%, in the control group – by 19%.', 'Wild yam or dioscorea (Dioscorea villosa) – the root contains phytoestrogens (diosgenin and dioscin), natural compounds that are precursors of dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), known as the "maternal hormone" or prohormone, from which about two dozen steroid hormones are synthesized in the body. Wild yam has a beneficial effect on the development of the corpus luteum and the preservation of pregnancy, with early pregnancy toxicosis. It is used for spasms and convulsions associated with premenstrual syndrome, due to its ability to dilate blood vessels.

Violation of evacuation of the contents of the large intestine and constipation associated with it is a rather unpleasant and unsafe phenomenon. To combat constipation, as a rule, medications are used that relate to stimulants of motor activity of the large intestine. However, these remedies do not always effectively solve the problem of constipation. A systematic approach is often required, in which it is necessary not only to affect the motility of the large intestine, but also to have an antispasmodic effect, stimulate the secretion of fluid and mucus, which helps to soften the contents of the rectum, to combat the consequences of chronic constipation – inflammation, violation of microbiocenosis, intoxication.

Of these, 12 can be formed in the body, and the remaining 8 are considered irreplaceable and must enter the body with food (lysine and threonine are absolutely indispensable for humans). However, often a person cannot provide himself with replaceable amino acids (glutamic acid and serine are absolutely interchangeable), which must also come with food. Animal proteins, the sources of which are dairy products, eggs, meat and fish, are the most useful for the human body in terms of amino acid composition. Vegetable proteins have a completely different amino acid composition. Among animal proteins, one of the best are whey proteins, which, unlike meat and casein, are easily and quickly digested and absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract.
Nutri Bern is a valuable source of easily digestible protein. The cocktail can be used during and after severe surgical operations, when traveling, when doing fitness and sports, as well as as a substitute for 1 meal in weight loss programs.

Garcinia extract is able to reduce fat production by 40-70% after eating and accelerates the breakdown of fat. At the same time, the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria increases, followed by their oxidation. Hydroxyl citric acid suppresses appetite, affecting the neurons of the hypothalamus responsible for the feeling of hunger. Garcinia works especially well in combination with chromium. Under the influence of hydroxyl citric acid, serotonin is produced in the human body, which affects sleep, appetite and mood. With a decrease in the amount of food taken, the level of serotonin in the body decreases, and garcinia is able to raise it. Garcinia extract is indicated for people suffering from increased appetite and bouts of depression.

Among the plant world, it is rare to find a plant that would help so effectively in the fight against cancer. Among such unique plants is asimina, which is native to North America. Its active substances, acetogenins, have the ability to block the production of energy in cancer cells and at the same time prevent the growth of blood vessels in the tumor tissue. Pah Pah of the NSP company based on azimina extract can be combined with therapeutic drugs used according to the standards of oncology treatment.', 'Pau Pau or Asimina triloba (Asimina triloba) – the highest content of active substances of acetogenins – in small twigs, seeds and tree bark. The action of acetogenins is aimed at reducing and stopping energy production in tumor cells that need a lot of energy, require high oxygen content and are very sensitive to hypoxia. Acetogenins inhibit the process of division of these cells, and also interfere with the mechanisms of elimination of antitumor drugs from them. Acetogenins also prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the tumor tissue. Disruption of the formation of new blood vessels feeding tumor tissues can stop tumor growth. This increases the chances of the patient''s immune system to fight tumor cells more successfully.

Improves the adaptation of vision in the dark', 'Many people have various vision problems throughout their lives. The eyes get tired, watery, react painfully to bright light, become inflamed. Eye health largely depends on the state of the body''s antioxidant system, because it protects the eyes from the aggressive effects of bright light and ultraviolet radiation, which cause the formation of oxygen radicals. The first structure of the eye that is aggressively exposed to light is the iris, followed by the lens and the macula (yellow spot), which, as a light filter, protects the retina of the eye. With a deficiency of antioxidants, the lens collapses and becomes cloudy over time, and cataracts occur, and then the retina begins to irreversibly collapse. The depletion of the visual pigment rhodopsin occurs with an increased load on vision associated with working on a computer, watching TV and other activities of a modern person.
Perfect Eye NSP (English: perfect Eyes) is a unique combination of nutritional components and antioxidants designed to improve vision. It prevents the destructive effect of free radicals, provides antioxidant protection to the lens, cornea and retina, and also restores the microcirculation of the eye.

Beta-carotene is a provitamin A, provides antioxidant protection, protects the membranes of retinal cells, normalizes metabolic processes in the cornea. Prevents the development of eye diseases such as progressive myopia, glaucoma, cataracts, uveitis, retinopathy of various etiologies, intraocular hemorrhages.
Lutein – zeaxanthin is formed from it in the tissues of the eye – the main pigment of the macula (macula). Lutein and zeaxanthin selectively absorb the dangerous blue part of the light flux spectrum, neutralizing the destructive effect of ultraviolet rays. Lutein deficiency leads to macular degeneration and damage to the retina. Elderly people often develop retinal dystrophy, a disease that leads to irreversible vision loss. It is the elderly, first of all, who are recommended to increase the intake of lutein.

Violation of intestinal microbiocenosis (a change in the ratio of representatives of the intestinal microflora) is called dysbiosis. This is a common phenomenon that may be accompanied by an increase in the number of pathogenic bacteria, for example, Staphylococcus or yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida, which may be present in the normal microflora of the mouth, vagina and colon of most healthy people. Candidiasis disease is caused not just by the presence of fungi of the genus Candida, but by their reproduction in large numbers. Candidiasis most often occurs with a decrease in general and local immunity. In women, candidiasis is more often manifested in the form of vulvovaginitis, urethritis and cystitis are less common. Men are characterized by inflammation of the foreskin, urethritis, and with inflammation of the prostate gland, prostatitis can develop. In many cases, candidiasis spreads to many organs, affecting the mucous membranes (oral cavity, intestines, genitourinary system). Most people are carriers (nails, intestines, etc.) of candidiasis blastospores, but normally the latter are in a "dormant" state. Candide growth is inhibited by other bacteria and the immune system. During pregnancy, taking estrogen-containing drugs (for example, oral contraceptives) and antibiotics, yeast-like fungi can "go into growth".
The complex with caprylic acid is recommended to be prescribed for stomatitis, periodontal disease, cystitis, urethritis, vulvovaginitis, prostatitis, enterocolitis, dysbiosis and after the end of the course of antibiotics. It is possible to combine the reception of the complex with Bifidophilus Flora Force NSP and Chlorophyll.', 'Caprylic acid is a medium chain fatty acid derived from coconuts.

The first scientific data on chlorophyll were published in 1940 in the American Journal of Surgery. It has been proven that it accelerates the processes of tissue regeneration. Dr. Robert Nara, studying the effect of chlorophyll on the microecology of the oral cavity, developed a caries prevention program using toothpaste containing chlorophyll. The effectiveness of chlorophyll in infectious diseases is shown. In 1979, in the USA, the effectiveness of chlorophyll, which prevents the occurrence of colon tumors, was experimentally confirmed.
In 1950, scientist Howard Wescott made a report that with regular use of chlorophyll, bad breath and the smell of sweat disappear.
It has been established that chlorophyll promotes the formation of connective tissue, which helps to heal erosions, ulcers, open wounds, enhances immune function. Chlorophyll helps to remove toxins from the body, and also acts as a weak diuretic. It has a stimulating effect on various organs and systems – cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, etc., has antioxidant activity. It increases the function of the thyroid gland and enhances the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, helps with anemia, regulates blood pressure, reduces nervousness. And, of course, one of the most amazing properties of chlorophyll is its antibacterial effect, and it does not matter whether it is an acute respiratory disease, sinusitis, chronic skin ulcer, cervical erosion, etc. Liquid chlorophyll can be used for douching in colpitis, as well as for rinsing the nasopharynx in ENT pathology.

With age, calcium deficiency develops: by the age of 40, it is observed in 50% of people, by the age of 60 – in 90%. Calcium deficiency is usually manifested by fatigue, early aging, decreased concentration, cramps of the calf muscles, diseases of the cardiovascular system. But in the blood, the normal calcium content can be determined, since it is being washed out of the bones, which leads to the development of osteoporosis. It is manifested by pain in the bones, impaired motor activity. It should be borne in mind that in some conditions calcium is excessively excreted from the body: strenuous physical work, intensive training for athletes, prolonged immobilization (restriction of mobility, bed rest).
Calcium is an important element of the body''s buffer system, which maintains the pH at the level necessary for each system and environment of the body. Unfortunately, the diet of most of us is made up in such a way that 80% of the products we consume daily are acid-forming. "Alkaline" products – fresh vegetables, fruits, dates, beans, almonds, linseed oil, etc. – make up no more than 20%.

Improve the breakdown and assimilation of nutrients.
Normalize the work of the digestive organs.', 'Dozens of different enzymes are involved in the digestive processes, which are secreted by the salivary glands, glands of the gastric mucosa, pancreas, intestinal epithelial cells. There are 3 main groups of digestive enzymes: proteases that break down proteins, lipases that break down fats, and amylases that break down starchy carbohydrates. Digestive disorders are often associated with a deficiency and with various disorders of the enzymes. When the digestive system does not cope with its function, specific symptoms may appear, such as nausea or heaviness in the stomach, belching, bloating, pain and rumbling in the abdomen, loose or unformed stools. Poorly digested food can cause food allergies, colitis, excessive bacterial growth. Digestive Enzymes will help overcome the deficiency of their own digestive enzymes.

It normalizes the acidity of the stomach, improves digestion with a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. It is useful for digestive disorders in the stomach, dyspepsia, a feeling of stomach overflow that occurs after eating.
Pancreatic alpha-amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starchy carbohydrates, obtained from the pancreas. The optimum pH is 6,7-7,0.
Pepsin is a proteolytic gastric enzyme that is produced by the main cells of the glands of the gastric mucosa. Pepsin works in an acidic environment and exhibits optimal activity at a pH of 1.4-2.5. In the case of an increase in pH, the activity of pepsin decreases, and at a pH of more than 6.0, it stops. The enzyme is destroyed by alcohol.
Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme derived from pineapple fruit. Bromelain is active both in the acidic environment of the stomach and in the neutral environment of the small intestine (the pH optimum of bromelain is 4.5–9.8) Bromelain has proteolytic activity against a variety of proteins. Bromelain digests fish, meat, dairy products and legumes especially well.
Papain is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins. It is found in pineapples, bananas, melon tree juice, kiwi fruits, mango, papaya (it is more in unripe fruits).

The most important biological role of chromium is to regulate carbohydrate metabolism and blood glucose levels. It regulates the deposition and use of glucose by cells, acting in conjunction with insulin. Chromium increases the sensitivity of cellular receptors to insulin, reducing the need for it, enhances its effect. Chromium deficiency can cause diabetes and, in addition to an increase in glucose levels, leads to an increase in triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. Therefore, chromium is of great importance for the prevention of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, enhances the process of heat production by the body, increases protein biosynthesis and carbohydrate reserves in the cell.

It is necessary for the formation of connective tissue, cartilage, joint fluid.
It facilitates the course of inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the joints and spine.', 'The human body is constantly undergoing processes of regeneration of cartilage tissue of the joints and spine, which allows them to maintain their health. Hard work, sports loads, injuries, obesity, age can accelerate the degradation of cartilage tissue and at the same time slow down the rate of its recovery, which leads to the destruction of joints or spine and usually ends with osteoarthritis or osteochondrosis. With the progression of this process, the mobility of the joint decreases, which is accompanied by inflammation and the appearance of pain. As a result, the joint cannot function normally and often requires surgical replacement. Accelerate the regeneration of cartilage tissue and restore joint health will help chondroprotectors, one of which is glucosamine, which the body uses as a material for the synthesis of components of cartilage tissue. Glucosamine NSP is recommended to be used in conjunction with Chondroitin and MSM.

Prevents the development of varicose veins, rosacea and other vascular disorders.
Supports blood flow in the extremities and in the vessels of the heart.', 'The main cause of varicose veins is a violation of the tone of the walls of the veins. This may be due to a violation of the formation of collagen and elastin in the walls of blood vessels, which is a consequence of connective tissue dysplasia. To support vascular health are important: activation of the formation of connective tissue proteins and stabilization of vascular tone.
To support the health of veins and blood vessels, NSP has created a product based on horse chestnut fruit extract, known as a means to increase vascular tone, reduce blood viscosity and strengthen the vein wall. The effect of the extract is enhanced by venotonics and capillaroprotectors: fenugreek extract, vitamin C, bioflavonoids hesperidin and rutin. This "smart" formula perfectly illustrates the phrase: "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
Horse chestnut fruits contain some toxic components. But the NSP company uses extraction methods, thanks to which this plant gives the product only useful properties without undesirable toxic effects.
The Vari-Gone is designed to support the tone, elasticity and nutrition of the walls of veins and blood vessels. Long-term use reduces the manifestation of varicose veins and vascular network, and also supports optimal blood flow to the heart and lower extremities.', 'Horse chestnut fruit extract (Aesculus hippocastanum) is rich in triterpene saponins (escin), tannins, vitamins C, K, B1, contains coumarin glycosides esculin, fraxin. Esculin reduces the permeability of capillaries, reduces the risk of thrombosis, increases the production of antithrombin, has a decongestant effect and reduces the fragility of capillaries. Escin has an angioprotective and venotonic effect and reduces blood viscosity. Horse chestnut is rich in antioxidants, including glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol. The active ingredients of horse chestnut improve metabolism and increase vascular strength, have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, help with post-thrombophlebitic syndrome and chronic venous insufficiency (including relieve swelling, cramps in the calf muscles, pain and a feeling of heaviness in the legs), varicose veins, trophic disorders, post-traumatic or postoperative soft tissue edema. The same properties allow the use of horse chestnut fruits in the treatment of hemorrhoids.
Horse Chestnut:
relieves inflammation, swelling and heaviness in the legs;
it has an analgesic effect;
strengthens the walls of blood vessels, reduces the permeability of capillaries;
expands the lumen of blood vessels, relieves spasm;
reduces blood viscosity, prevents the formation and promotes the resorption of blood clots;
accelerates the healing of wounds and trophic ulcers;
prevents the occurrence of rosacea (vascular asterisks, meshes and meshes — persistent expansion of small vessels).
The effectiveness of horse chestnut fruit extract can be equated to wearing compression stockings to maintain the health of leg veins. There are also facts that say that this plant is useful for maintaining male reproductive health.
Vitamin C has a powerful antioxidant effect, prevents the destruction of the inner wall of capillaries (by neutralizing free radicals), eliminates oxygen starvation of cells, strengthens the connective tissue of large arteries, improves vascular tone, stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin, prevents the accumulation of cholesterol.

It is believed that the need for L-carnitine is 300 — 900 mg, however, the physiological need for it is much higher and may exceed 1500 mg.
The action of L-carnitine is based on the transfer of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane, where they are burned, releasing energy. And energy production is a key factor in supporting the work of the heart, muscle tissue, liver, central nervous system, kidneys and other organs.
It allows you to burn significant fat deposits if you take the drug and perform physical exercises.
Dietary supplement L-carnitine can be recommended:
as a cardioprotector – supports the work of the myocardium in everyday life and in critical conditions;
as a neuroprotector – increases the efficiency of the brain and cognitive function in conditions of increased stress, as well as in acute and chronic diseases;
as a hepatoprotector – supports the work of liver cells, reducing the severity of fatty hepatosis and preventing the development of liver failure;
as a fat burner in weight loss and sports programs for adults and children;
as an antioxidant, it is a radical trap, destroys peroxides and increases the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes;
for people involved in sports in order to increase energy production and support the work of muscle tissue.
For the production of the product, NSP uses encapsulated L-carnitine, which is protected by a special shell of cellulose derivatives and long-chain triglycerides, so that it is less hygroscopic than L-carnitine in its natural form, and retains its integrity on the way to the intestine.', 'L-carnitine is a derivative of aminobutyric acid, formed in the body from two essential amino acids lysine and methionine. It is also present in food, mainly as part of meat products. But as calculations show, a person lacks his own and food resources of L-carnitine, given that its formation in the body reaches a maximum in 14-15 years, and only decreases with age. In addition, cases of various congenital disorders of L-carnitine formation and metabolism are not uncommon.
Indications for the appointment of L-carnitine
